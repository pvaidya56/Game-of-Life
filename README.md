## Conway's Game of Life Project 

### Description 

Conway's Game of Life is the most known Cellular Automaton invented by the British mathematician John Conway in 1970. It is actually a zero-player game, its evolution is determined by its initial state, and a certain set of rules requiring no further input afterwards. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

### Rules of the Game
- Birth: Each dead cell adjacent to exactly three live neighbors will become live in the next generation.
- Death by isolation: Each live cell with one or fewer live neighbors will die in the next generation.
- Death by overpopulation: Each live cell with four or more live neighbors will die in the next generation.
- Survival: Each live cell with either two or three live neighbors will remain alive for the next generation.
